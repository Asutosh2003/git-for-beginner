Cheat Sheet - Git Commands Used in This Section
In this section, you installed and configured Git on your machine. To configure Git, you learned about different commands.

You used the following Git commands
Show the version of your Git installation:

git -v

Show the configurations:

git config -l

Configure your username and email:

git config --global user.name "Thomas Claudius Huber"

git config --global user.email "thomas@...com"

The username and email is used by Git for every commit that you will create. Without this configuration, you are not able to commit to a repository.

To show the origin of the configurations, you learned about the --show-origin parameter. It shows you in which file a configuration is located:

git config -l --show-origin

This command above allows you to find the .gitconfig file that is in your user directory. That .gitconfig file contains now the username and the email that you configured.

Now, Git is set up and configured. This means you're ready for some work! :-)


In the next section, you will learn how to work with local repositories. But before that, let's test your knowledge with some learning questions.

Stage a specific file:

Commit the staged files:

Define notepad as an editor. It will be used when you run the git commit command without -m parameter:

git config --global core.editor notepad

Show the changes of a specific file:

git diff readme.txt

Show the changes in your working directory:

git diff

Show the changes in your staging area:

git diff --staged

Show the history/log:

git log

Show the history/log with one commit per line:

git log --pretty=oneline

Checkout a specific commit by its snapshot hash:

git checkout b346471

Navigate back to your main branch:

git checkout main

Now you know how to work with a local repository.

In the next section, you will learn how to branch and merge your code. This can be helpful when you want to work on different features in parallel. But before that, let's test your knowledge with some learning questions.
